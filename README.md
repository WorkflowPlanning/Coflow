# Coflow
The workload of the coflow

The unzipped of the workload contains the workload used to evaluate our proposed Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based Coflow scheduling (GAC) solving the Computation Resource Optimisation and Coflow Scheduling (CROCS) problem.

Each folder contains an instance to evaluate the algorithm. 

The description of the folder name:

For instance, 1.32.3.4. The first number is used to identify the iterations we used to generate the workflow. In the opened dataset, we post only 1 iteration. The second number is used to denote the number of computation stages in the workflow. The third and fourth number are used to represent the parameters to generate the workflow. We use the famous Fan-in/Fan-out method (GGen tool, https://github.com/perarnau/ggen) to generate the workflows. 

In each folder,

The "1.32.3.5.propfile" is used to describe the original workflows generated by GGen. 

The "1.32.3.5.dag" is used to describe the workflows adding an entry and exit node. 

The "coflow" is used to represent the coflows between computation stages. Each line describes one coflow.

The "deadline" is used to represent the deadline of the workflow which requires that the makespan of the workflow not exceeding the deadline.

The "performance" is used to describe how the computation stages perform on different types of computing nodes.

The "cost" is used to describe the cost of different types of computing nodes.
